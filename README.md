# CORD-19 Dataset Author Statistics

The CORD-19 dataset of COVID-19 publications is published weekly at [CORD-19 Historical Releases](https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/historical_releases.html). 

In order to understand the distribution of authors on papers in this dataset, this repository requests data from the latest published dataset, calculates author statistics on publications in that dataset, and then appends the latest statistics to the [data file](/data/CORD-19-historical-releases.csv).
